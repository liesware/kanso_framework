# Kanso Framework — LaTeX Source

**Kanso Framework** is an open-source operational simplicity framework designed to **identify, quantify, and reduce the hidden cost of complexity** in modern organizations.

This repository contains the **official LaTeX source code** used to produce the Kanso Framework document.

## What is Kanso?

Modern organizations operate increasingly complex ecosystems: tools, pipelines, approvals, handoffs, integrations, and processes layered over time.  
While each component promises efficiency, their interaction often creates **hidden operational friction** that traditional models like TCO fail to measure.

Kanso introduces a practical way to:

- Make operational friction visible  
- Quantify hidden OPEX waste  
- Reduce avoidable complexity  
- Improve operational flow without imposing new methodologies  

In short:

> **Scrum helps you deliver better.  
> Kanso helps you operate with less friction.**

## Core Concepts

Kanso is built around a few key ideas:

- **Operational Friction** — Time and effort lost due to avoidable inefficiencies  
- **Cost of Complexity** — OPEX + hidden overhead caused by friction  
- **Kanso Index (IK)** — Percentage of OPEX wasted in avoidable friction  
- **Friction Ledger** — Living inventory of operational friction  
- **Friction RCA** — Root Cause Analysis focused on flow, not blame  
- **Harmony Board** — Lightweight executive dashboard for efficiency  

Kanso is **framework-agnostic** and can coexist with Scrum, DevOps, ITIL, Lean, or no formal framework at all.

## Philosophy

Kanso is not about control.
It is not about surveillance.
It is not about adding more process.

Kanso exists to answer a simple question:

Where is our energy being wasted — and why?

Simplicity is not accidental.
Operational clarity requires deliberate design.

## Language Availability

**Important note**

At the moment, the Kanso Framework is available **only in Spanish**.

An English version is planned, but has not yet been released.  
The LaTeX source in this repository currently generates the Spanish edition of the document.

Contributions, translations, and discussions around an English version are welcome.
